# MikpEngine
Playground for a vulkan-based render engine. Nothing serious.

Currently written in Rust using ash as its vulkan crate and gpu-allocator for allocation.

Writing my own math-lib for this, since I want to keep it basic, no simd planned. ![mikpe_path](https://github.com/Mik-pe/mikpe_math)

Can currently display a scene with some textured models in it.

Will develop in my own pace. Will be testing out lots of layers both as a way to get ahold on Vulkan, but also in order to try out multi-threaded GPU uploads later on!
