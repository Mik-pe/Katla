# rust_shared_glctx
Playground which tests out a shared context for e.g. resource uploads

Currently written in Rust using erupt as its vulkan crate.

Will develop in my own pace. Will be testing out lots of layers both as a way to get ahold on Vulkan, but also in order to try out multi-threaded GPU uploads later on! 


# Current TODO:s

- Multiple Vertex attributes
- Multiple Shaders based on vert attribs
- Texture upload/usage
- Threaded upload
